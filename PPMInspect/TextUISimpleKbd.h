/**
 * @brief A driver for buttons attached to Arduino input pins.
 * 
 * The driver distinguishes between short and long press of a button.
 * It also supports auto repeat. 
 * 
 * A short press (shorter than BUTTON_LONG_TIMEOUT_msec, currently 250 mSec) 
 * creates an Event with a corresponding short key defined during construction 
 * of the driver. 
 * 
 * A long press (between BUTTON_LONG_TIMEOUT_msec and BUTTON_REPEAT_TIMEOUT_msec)
 * creates an Event with a corresponding long key defined during construction
 * of the driver.
 * 
 * If the button is pressed longer than BUTTON_REPEAT_TIMEOUT_msec, the short key
 * Event is repeated every BUTTON_REPEAT_SPEED_msec (currently 50 mSec) until the
 * button is released.
 * 
 *  Example:   
 *  
 *      #include "TextUI.h"
 *      #include "TextUISimpleKbd.h"
 * 
 *      const uint8_t BUTTON_COUNT = 3;
 *      uint8_t buttons[BUTTON_COUNT] = { 14, 15, 16 };
 *      uint8_t shortKeys[BUTTON_COUNT] = { KEY_UP, KEY_ENTER, KEY_DOWN };
 *      uint8_t longKeys[BUTTON_COUNT] = { KEY_NONE, KEY_BACK, KEY_CLEAR };
 *
 *      TextUI textUI;
 *      textUI.setInput( new TextUISimpleKbd( BUTTON_COUNT, buttons, shortKeys, longKeys));
